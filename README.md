# 🌀 Atlantic Hurricanes Dataset Project


### 📝 Project Summary
This repository contains an Excel-based analysis of a dataset of the most significant hurricanes in Atlantic history. The project demonstrates the use of the `SWITCH` function in Excel.

### 🎯 Key skills demonstrated:

### 🗂️ Dataset Structure
The initial dataset contained:
* Historical Atlantic hurricane data (1870 - 2017) including dates, financial impact, maximum wind speed.
* A table listing the Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories.  
   * The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a classification system used to measure the intensity of hurricanes based on their maximum wind speed.
   * The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with hurricanes assigned as Category 5 having the highest maximum wind speed and those assigned Category 1 having the lowest wind speed.
     
* The below key metrics have been recorded for each hurricane; each represents a column of the dataset:
  
| Column Name           | Description                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                  | The official name of hurricane                             |
| Start Date            | The date the storm began                                   |
| Damage (USD Millions) | The estimated financial impact of the storm at the time    |
| Category              | Saffir-Simpson hurricane category (1-5)                    |

### 🛠️ Excel Skills Demonstrated
#### ☑️ `SWITCH` Function
Used the `SWITCH` function to assign a maximum wind speed for each hurricane based on its Saffir-Simpson category. 

---
### 🧩Process
The goal was to categorise hurricanes in the dataset according to wind speed using the SWITCH function, ensuring consistent classification across all records. 
 
#### ⤵️ Data Loading
- Imported the dataset into Excel and reviewed the dataset to understand the structure and key variables.
- Checked that dates, numbers and text were in the correct format.
- Ensured there were no missing values.

#### 🔀 `SWITCH` Function
- Inserted a new column,'Max Wind Speed', to store assigned maximum wind speeds.
- Applied the `SWITCH` function to assign each hurricane a maximum wind speed.

- Checked a random selection of rows to ensure the formulas had worked correctly. 
- **Example of formula used:**  
`=SWITCH(D4,1,95,2,110,3,129,4,156,5,"157 and over", "Unknown")`

### 🪞 Reflection 
* Each hurricane in the dataset now has a clearly assigned maximum wind speed.
* The categorisation makes it easier to filter, sort and analyse storms by severity.
* The most damaging hurricanes were Irma (2017, $300,000M) Katrina (2005, $108,000M) and Jeanne (2004, $7,660M).
* Most hurricanes reached Category 4 and 5, with maximum speeds of 156 mph and 157+ mph respectively.
* Lower-category hurricanes can still cause significant damage e.g., Fifi-Orlene (Category 2, $1,800M) caused more damage than Category 5 hurricane David ($1,540M).
